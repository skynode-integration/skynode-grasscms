    * Added ability to prefix routes when using a proxy
        * When using the NPM in a node project you can prefix your api routes to keep them separate from your app
        * Usage (notice - no trailing slash)

            ```javascript
            var app = express(),
                ghapi = require('grasshopper-api');

            // Setup routes for the api
            app.set('grasshopper route prefix', '/api');
            ghapi(app);

            // Setup routes for the app that is using the api
            app.get('/myroutes/*?', function(req, res) {
            ```
