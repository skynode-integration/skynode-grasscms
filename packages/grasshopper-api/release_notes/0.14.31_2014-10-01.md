## 0.14.31

* Features
    * GRAS-1692 API: Would be nice to have ability to configure bodyParser when the ghapiRouter is initialized.
        * If you would like to configure the limit on requests passed to the express body-parser middleware, you can specify the desired limit by adding a bodyParser object to your ghapi.json.
        * The limit object can accept values such as "1mb", "100kb" etc.  It will then get passed to grasshopper api with the rest of your options from ghapi.json.

            ```
            "bodyParser" : {
                "limit" : "yourLimitHere"
            }
            ```
