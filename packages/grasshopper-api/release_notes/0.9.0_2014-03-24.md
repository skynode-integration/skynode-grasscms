    * ghapi can now be loaded using a proxy
        * this means that the api no longer requires its own express server, one can be passed in
        * suggested use is to put the api routes at the top:

            ```javascript
            var app = express(),
                ghapi = require('grasshopper-api');
                
            // Setup routes for the api
            ghapi(app);

            // Setup routes for the app that is using the api
            app.get('/myroutes/*?', function(req, res) {
            ```
