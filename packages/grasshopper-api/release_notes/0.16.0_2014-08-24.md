## 0.16.0

* Features
    * Grasshopper Core 0.16.2 support
    * includes support for /full on getById and content:

        ```javascript
        request(url).post('/content/query/full')...
        request(url).get('/content/123/full')...
        ```

    * `/full` will return an object with all content reference ids replaced by the objects they reference.
        This is done recursively. It is similar to mongoose populate, but all references are replaced "infinitely" deep, not just certain paths.
