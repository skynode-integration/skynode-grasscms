## 0.13.3

* patches
    * removed some logger entries that were cluttering log files
    * changed the `between` and `notbetween` queries to accept an array instead of splitting a string.

        Example:
        ```
            var filter = { key: 'myfield', cmp: 'between', value: [ new Date(2010, 01, 01), new Date(2014, 01, 01) ] };
        ```

        Note: [ min, max ]
