## 0.13.11-auth

* patches
    * Added middleware to create a linked identities array on the user during user insert. Added tests.
        The Linked Identities array will contain an array of all linked identities

        ```javascript
        var user = {
            // ... other user stuff
            linkedIdentities : [
                'google',
                'basic'
            ]
        }
        ```
