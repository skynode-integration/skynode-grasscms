## 0.4.1

* features
    * major content and user query change. The data definition is now the same as the `list` call

Example:

    var obj = {
          total: <total number of results>,
          limit: <passed in limit of results that will get returned>,
          skip: <starting position>,
          results: [array of results]
      }

NOTE: This is not backwards compatible with v0.3.x of grasshopper core, but no migration is required.
