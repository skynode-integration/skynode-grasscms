## 0.18.8

* Patch: Updated db models to add a `slug` property to content, contentTypes, users and nodes. This means that the API should support adding custom URIs. This work updated the models and properties in the db. There is more work to be able to use this new data. Coming out next release.
* Patch: Added a `destination` property to the contentType model. This will be used in the future for mapping contentTypes to a specific collection.
