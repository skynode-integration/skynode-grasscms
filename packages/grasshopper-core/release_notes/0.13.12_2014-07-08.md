## 0.13.12-auth

* patches
    * Added middleware that will set a displayName on the user during insert.
        1. If the user is authenticated with basic auth, then the display name will default to the login.
        1. If the user is authenticated with google auth, then the display name will default to the email address.
        1. The displayName is easily overridden.

    * Added user.link() and user.unlink() methods. These will be used to link and unlink a user from an identity.
    * Added logic to protect the identities object. It will NEVER be returned. An App should interact with the identities by using the link and unlink methods.
