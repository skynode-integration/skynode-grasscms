## 0.16.2

* Patches - added full to query, so it is support for `getFullById` and `queryFull`
  *  can query a piece of content so that all content references are followed and filled in

    ```javascript
    grasshopper
        .request(token)
        .content.queryFull(aQuery)
    ```

  * full will fill in all references for all things in fields, recursively as deep as your server doesn't crash. It is similar to mongoose's populate.
