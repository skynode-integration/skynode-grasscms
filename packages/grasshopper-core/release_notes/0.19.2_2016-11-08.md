0.19.2

Patches
* Added a new event to be fired when the system is shutting down. This way, our apps can hook into the event listener and clean up the system before shutdown.

```
grasshopper.core.event.channel('/system')
        .on('shutdown', onShutdown);
```

* Added a `runner` to allow the app to kill the grasshopper instance with a logged in `admin` user. This is important in case our apps hijack `SIGINT`.

```
grasshopper.request(adminToken).system.shutdown();
```
