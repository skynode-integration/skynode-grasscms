## 0.4.4

* features
    * added middleware to set the computed properties of a piece of content when it is inserted/updated
    * cached contentTypes internally and update them every time they are updated. Types change infrequently and need to be accessed regularly.
    * added typelabel to the content meta collection so that users can easily read the type a piece of content is in the database.

* bugs
    * if bad validation data came into contentType then would crash. Changed it to checked for the correct data and ignore bad data.
