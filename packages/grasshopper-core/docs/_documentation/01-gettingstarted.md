### Getting started

You will find that many concepts that modern applications need are built right into Grasshopper. User management, flexible data storage, permissions, plus much more are bundled into the framework.

Grasshopper is modular and built on top of a modern web development stack. It was written entirely in JavaScript and it uses a NoSQL database system. File storage can either be local or in the cloud on a CDN. As the project matures, more database systems and CDN options will become available.

Currently, Grasshopper will run in any environment that supports Node.js and MongoDB. This is great news since loading Node.js apps into modern cloud containers is very simple. Users hosting the application themselves or using services like Heroku, Engine Yard or any other PaaS (Platform as a Service) are fully supported.

Every implementation of the system is different but keep reading and you will start to get a sense of how the project is organized.
