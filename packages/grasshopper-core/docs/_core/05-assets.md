#### Assets

Data is great, but many applications require binary assets. Grasshopper allows you to fully manage the assets that your application uses.

Grasshopper allows you to store assets in nodes. You can either query out the assets that are in a node, or you can link an asset to a piece of content.

Store your files either locally or publish to a CDN. Amazon S3 integration is included and any CDN that provides an API is fully compatible.
